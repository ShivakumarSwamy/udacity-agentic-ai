What are some key aspects of feedback loops in LLMs that contribute to their effectiveness?

- Effective monitoring is necessary to evaluate the success of feedback loops in improving output quality.
- Feedback loops enable LLM to learn and improve their outputs over multiple iterations.
- User input can serve as a valuable source of feedback to refine LLM outputs.
