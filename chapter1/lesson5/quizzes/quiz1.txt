You are prompting an AI to solve a classic logic puzzle. The puzzle is:

"""
"You have three boxes. One is labeled 'APPLES', one is labeled 'ORANGES', and one is labeled 'APPLES AND ORANGES'.
You know that every single label is on the wrong box. You are allowed to pick only one fruit from one box
(without looking inside) to figure out the correct labels for all three. Which box should you pick from?"
"""

To solve this, the AI needs to reason through the problem internally. It doesn't need an external tool, but it does need a logical plan.

Question: What is the first critical reasoning step the AI must take, which a Chain-of-Thought prompt would help it deduce?
