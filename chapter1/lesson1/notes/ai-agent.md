## AI Agent

- An agent is an intelligent system capable of **perceiving its environment, making decisions,
  and taking actions to achieve specific goals.**
- AI Agents move beyond static rules or simple generation to **reasoning, planning, and acting** towards a goal using
  tools.
- An agent decides on actions, potentially using external tools, and observes the results to inform its next steps.

## Components of an AI Agent

- Large Language Models
- Tools (API's or resources)
- Instructions (system prompt)
- Memory (short-term memory or long-term memory)
- Runtime/Orchestration Layer (control execution flow)

## Why Build with Agents?

- Enabled execution of complex workflows
- Allow actions in the real world (digital or physical via APIs)
- Integration LLM reasoning with tools and planning
