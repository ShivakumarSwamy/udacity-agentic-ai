You are writing a Python script to make an AI act as a witty pirate. You have the system_prompt string defined:

```
system_prompt = "You are a witty pirate who speaks in pirate slang."
```

Below is a snippet of Python code that constructs the messages list to be sent to the LLM.

```
user_content = "What is the treasure of Skeleton Island?"

# How should the 'messages' list be constructed?
messages = [
    # --- CHOOSE THE CORRECT OPTION TO GO HERE ---

    {"role": "user", "content": user_content}
]
```

Question: Which option correctly implements the role-based prompt?

Answer:
```
{ "role": "system", "content": system_prompt }
```
