When creating a plan to declutter and organize your workspace within an hour using only existing household items, I want to focus on efficiency and practicality.

       "\n",
       "1. **Assessment and Preparation (10 minutes):**  \n",
       "   Starting with a quick visual scan helps identify the main clutter hotspots and prioritize what needs immediate attention. It also allows you to gather any household items you might want to use as organizers (like jars, containers, or trays).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Clear the Surface (10 minutes):**  \n",
       "   Clearing your desk or workspace surfaces immediately creates a sense of order and provides space to work. Using existing items like a dish towel or a piece of fabric as a temporary mat can help protect surfaces and organize items temporarily.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Sort and Categorize Items (20 minutes):**  \n",
       "   Group similar items together—papers, pens, electronics, chargers, notepads. Use existing containers like mugs, jars, or empty boxes to temporarily hold these groups. This step helps you see what you truly need and what can be discarded or relocated.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Declutter and Discard (10 minutes):**  \n",
       "   Quickly identify items that are no longer needed—old papers, broken pens, expired sticky notes—and recycle or discard them. This reduces visual clutter and makes the space more functional.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Organize and Store (10 minutes):**  \n",
       "   Use the containers you've gathered to designate specific spots for different categories of items. For example, pens in a mug, papers in a stack, chargers coiled neatly. If you have a drawer or shelf, allocate space accordingly. This step turns a chaotic desk into an organized station.\n",
