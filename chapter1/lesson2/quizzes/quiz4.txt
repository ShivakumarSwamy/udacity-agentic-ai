Your team is building a new AI-powered customer support chatbot for an e-commerce website.
The agent is designed with a clear, multi-step prompt chain: it first identifies the user's product category,
then retrieves FAQs for that category, and finally, drafts an answer based on the retrieved information.

The chatbot needs to handle thousands of common customer questions per day,
and user experience (getting a fast answer) is a top priority.

- Start with a smaller, faster model (like GPT-4o-mini). Since the task is broken down to clear steps
  (identify, retrieve, draft), this model is likely capable enough. This approach prioritizes low latency for the user
  and keeps operational costs down.
