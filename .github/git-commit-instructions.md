# Git Commit Instructions

Please follow these guidelines for writing commit messages:

## Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and structure your commit messages as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
```

- **type**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc.
- **scope**: Briefly indicate the area or feature affected by the change (e.g., a module, component, or functionality).

## Examples

- `feat(auth): add user login functionality`
- `fix(api): correct response format for errors`
- `docs(readme): update project overview`

## Additional Guidelines

- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "add", "fix", "update").
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
- Add a body if more detail is needed.
- Reference issues or tasks if applicable.

For more details, see the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
